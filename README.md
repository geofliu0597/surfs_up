## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to gather data to make a more informed decision on whether or not a ice-cream and surfing shop in Oahu would work year round. 

## Results

 - The minimum temperature is 10 degrees colder during december
 - Mean temperature does not change significantly
 - Max temperature also does not change significantly

## Summary
Since surfing in Hawaii over the summer is already pretty much a given, the main question is whether or not the conditions change enough in the middle of winter to continue running a surf shop at this particular location. 

With the overall temperature not changing too significantly (drops by 3 degrees on average), a surf shop should still be able to continue running most of winter. The minimum temperature is quite a significantly 10 degree drop though but should only affect business a few days during the winter when it drops to the lowest annual temperatures.

Other queries that I would perform are one for precipitation because precipitation is also a large consideration when doing any outdoor activities. 
Another query to consider is the temperature of the water and whether or not that drops significantly and whether or not it would still be at a comfortable swimming temperature. You feel the cold much more in the water, and colder waters could move in at different times of year.
